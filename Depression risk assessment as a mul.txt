Depression risk assessment as a multimodal approach that incorporates audio, text, and visual
data inputs. Audio data in most occasions is clipped clinician-patient interviews while text data
is preprocessed for sentiment and linguistic markers of depression using NLTK among others.
Facial images wherein visual data is input are processed with CNNs in an effort to get at the
emotion displayed from facial expressions. The extracted features of all three modalities are
compounds and this give an overall picture of the subject’s mental condition. A machine
learning model is trained on these combined features to classify individuals into different
depression risk levels: Low, Moderate, or High. This integrated method improves on accuracy
due to the use of multiple indicators; this gives a much richer picture of the symptoms of
depression for clinical purposes.
The method helps to ensure that the depression detection is enhanced by the audio, text,and
visually different from the other and thus more robust than using any single modality. Toneand
pitch of utterances extract state information, whereas, textual analysis extracts depressive
speech patterns. Facial expressions are nonverbal forms of determining the emotional state of
a person after sedation. And by combining these features, the model can consider some
indicators of depression that might occur, but might not be detected if only this type of data
was used. The multimodal suggested here also envisages to help the professionals assess more
accurately and provide a more suitable and targeted manner with reference to the risk level.
Data Collection:
The system gathers three types of inputs:
Visual Data: Smile, frowning, and tilting ones head were demonstrated by the users either
through webcam or image uploads.
Audio Data: Microphone input(s) in the form of digitized speech or live inputs from a speech
input device.
Textual Data: Responses in the form of textual inputs gathered from self-generated surveys
and typewritten narratives of recorded discussions.
It is responsible for good data input as it checks on the format and quality of inputs.
Data preparation is a close match for preprocessing, while feature extraction or feature
engineering is the next step in the data analysis process.
Visual Preprocessing:
These frames may be normalized in terms of resizing, and the face regions are found in order
to analyze. Facial expressions including eye movement, frowns or smile are performed using
a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Audio Preprocessing: The vocal aspect of the communication process is examined in terms of
tone, the pitch of the voices involved in the conversation and the rhythm. Such properties like
monotone intonation, or slow speech rate, characteristic of the depressive state, for example,
are detected.
Text Preprocessing: Text data is also preprocessed before analysis by removal of white spaces,
stop words, and even punctuation from the text data we are analyzing and furthermore bag of
words, features extraction and selection, evaluation of linguistic and sentiment analysis using
NLTK tools are also employed.
Integration of features and the fusion of multiple modalities:
Visual, auditory, and textual data from which features are obtained are fused using fusion
techniques.Fusion enables the possibility of considerations of correlations, such as from
gestural modality, as gaугed by vocal tone and facial expressions.
Depression Classifier:

Finally the data psychologically integrated is processed through an Artificial intelligence
model that classifies the severity level of the depression, whether low, moderate, severe or
otherwise.The classifier integrates features from all the modalities for better detection of
mental disorders.to reframe mental health assessment and treatment globally.
Real-Time Detection Module:

For live analysis, webcam sources are employed and the system determines the facial
expressions instantaneously.Can produce the result instantly to the users and this scares the
system a high level of proactivity.
Visualization and results reporting :

It can be categorized as properly serving the target audience since they entail informing or
educating, persuading, or reminding the target audience of a particular topic through the use
of ways other than printed or written text.
All the outputs are shown on a clear user interface which gives the lunching service important
results of the analyses such as detected emotional states, level of detected depression, and
recommendations.For better clarity of the results by non-heavy users, it supports figures in
form of graphs or charts or even emojis.
Alert and Recommendations:

Provides notification if depression level goes up.
Mentor offers incentives like contacts of mental health professionals, ways of managing
depressive episodes or suggestions on when to consult one.
Scalability and Integration:

This architecture also includes easy integration with cloud services to aid scalability and the
possibility of analysis for many users at the same time.Compatible with APIs for third-party
services such as teleconsultation services and datasets of mental health.
This architecture stresses the extensiveness of the identified and extracted inputs to be
processed and integrated into actual, yet user-friendly and privacy-preserving implications of
major depression. It looks at a organisation and modular and scalable means of coping with
mentalities of health difficulties with classy AI technology in delivery worldwide.
